# obaranda-push
A simple nodejs web app that polls www.obaranda.com for comic updates and sends push messages via firebase to registered clients. It also exposes a [REST API](#the-api) for accessing the comics.

## The app
The web app periodically monitors the json feed at www.obaranda.com. An external scheduling service/ cron job is responsible for the timing and should send a `POST` request to `/poll`. The request should be authenticated using `Basic Authentication` with the username and password supplied in the `POLL_USERNAME` and `POLL_PASSWORD` environment variables respectively.

The comics data is cached in [firebase firestore][1] and a [firebase function][2] monitors new additions to firestore and sends push messages using [firebase messaging][3].

### Setup
You need to have [Node JS](https://www.nodejs.org) and [Npm](https://www.npmjs.org) installed.
 - Clone this repo locally
 - Create a `.env` file and add your equivalent of the following variables
   ```
   # Username and password of basic auth for the /poll endpoint
   POLL_USERNAME=<your_value>
   POLL_PASSWORD=<your_value>
   
   # Url for the obaranda comic json feed. See [blob/master/src/app/poll/index.ts#L142]
   OBARANDA_FEED_URL=<your_value>
   
   # See the firebase admin setup [guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup#initialize_the_app)
   FIREBASE_DB_URL=<your_value>
   ```
 - Follow the instructions in [this link](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup#add_firebase_to_your_app) to download a firebase service account key.
   Add the json file to your project and edit [`service-account-key.ts`](src/app/service-account-key.ts#L3) to export your service account from:
   ```typescript
   export default {} as ServiceAccount;
   ```
   to
   ```typescript
   export default require('path/to/service-account.json') as ServiceAccount;
   ```

### Run locally
```sh
npm install
```
and then 
```sh
npm start
```
If successful, the app is now available at http://localhost:8080/.

### Tests
Sigh. There are no tests (for now). Contributions are welcome.

## The API
There is a publicly available API for retrieving comics at https://obaranda-push.herokuapp.com/api/. 
It is an unauhenticated API with no usage limits (yet) and no versioning scheme.

### JSON Only
The API currently supports JSON as the only data format. All requests that return data will return JSON data with a `Content-Type` header of `Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8`.

### Pagination
Endpoints that return collections will offer basic pagination via `limit` and `offset` query parameters.
- `limit` specifies the number of items to return
- `offset` specifies the 0-based result offset. This is usually the total count of already retrieved items

The API follows the [RFC5988 convention](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988) of using the `Link` header to provide URLs for the `next` and `prev` page and an `X-Total-Count` header to provide the total item count for the collection in question. It is recommended to follow this convention than build the pagination URLs manually.

### Error Handling
The API uses HTTP status codes to signify errors. HTTP responses with status `4xx` signify consumer errors while status `5xx` errors are indicative of server failures. It is safe to retry api calls (with exponential backoff) in the case of `5xx` errors. Irregardless of the HTTP status code, errors **always** have a JSON error body like:
```json
{
  "name": "Error | <SpecificConstantErrorName>",
  "message": "Non-localized best effort text trying to explain the cause of the error"
}
```
